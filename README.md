  - **memo**: use computed states
  - **side effect**: react for state changing
- Stage 2
  - **styling**: inline CSS with scope
  - **import alef component** - `import Logo from "./Logo.alef"`
  - **slots** - `<Logo><img ... /></Logo>`
  - **reuse pattern** - reuse common logics
  - **stores** - share state between components
- Stage 3
  - **SSR** - server side rendering
